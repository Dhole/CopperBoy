# records files

This directory contains timed input recorings of playthoughs of some Arduboy games.  This files are
intended to be used for automatic testing of "real life" executions.  Without using a playthough
recording, most games will stay in a welcome menu that doesn't do anything interesting.

These recordings are also useful for benchmarking and profiling "real life" executions of games.
