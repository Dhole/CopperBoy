# sdl Rust package

`sdl` is a cross-platform emulator frontend using the `arduboy` emulator library.  As it name says,
it uses the SDL2 library to handle the video and audio output and the keyboard input.  This should
build in any system with SDL2 and Rust support.

This frontend is mainly used for testing as an example; and as such has a limited set of features
implemented.  It will be kept simple, and may contain some temporary debugging functionality.
